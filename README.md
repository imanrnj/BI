# BI Project Repository

This repository contains the code for a Business Intelligence (BI) project. The project aims to perform data analysis and generate valuable insights from the provided dataset. The folder structure and files in this repository are as follows:

- `analysis.py`: This file contains the main analysis script. It includes functions for data processing, aggregation, visualization, and generating insights from the data.

- `functions.py`: This file contains utility functions that are used in the `analysis.py` script. These functions provide common functionality required for data manipulation and analysis.

- `README.md`: This file serves as the documentation for the project. It provides an overview of the project, instructions on how to set up the project, run the tests, and details about the functions and utilities available in the project.

- `tempDb.json`: This JSON file contains the temporary database or dataset used for analysis. The data in this file will be loaded into the analysis script for further processing.

- `test.py`: This file includes test cases to validate the correctness of the functions defined in `functions.py` and the analysis performed in `analysis.py`. Proper testing ensures the reliability and accuracy of the project.

## Project Overview

The objective of this BI project is to analyze the provided dataset and extract meaningful insights to support decision-making. The dataset is loaded from `tempDb.json`, and the analysis is performed using the functions defined in `functions.py` and the main analysis script `analysis.py`.

## Setting Up the Project

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/iwishco/iwish-bi
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies. This project uses Python, and you can set up a virtual environment if needed.

## Running the Tests

To run the test cases and ensure the correctness of the functions, follow these steps:

1. Open the terminal and navigate to the project directory.

2. Execute the `test.py` script using the following command:
   ```
   python test.py
   ```

3. The script will run the test cases and display the results indicating whether the functions pass the tests or not.

## Documentation

Each function in the project must have a Python docstring that explains its purpose, inputs, and outputs. The documentation serves as a reference for developers and users of the project, helping them understand the functions' functionalities without diving into the implementation details.
